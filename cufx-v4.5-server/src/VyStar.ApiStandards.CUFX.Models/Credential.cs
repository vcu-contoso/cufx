It is used to access an account when the person is using a computer system. The user usually selects their user name during signup.  It is typically unique for that individual or account across the entire system of record. Password is a combination of characters known by the user that is used to access an account when the person is on a computer system. The ATM PIN is usually a 4 digit number with no spaces that is used at an ATM terminal to access cash funds, inquire about balances or perform transfers. Depending upon the provider, this number can be randomly generated or selected by the user at time they create an account or activate their ATM card. Codeword is used to access an account in person or over the phone. This is typically different than the password used when electronically accessing the account. A token that was generated by a system for accessing a system.  Tokens can be rather lengthy to keep them confidential. A question that the user has selected that is paired with a security answer, which the system uses to confirm that the person is authorized to the account.  This is typically used in resetting the password on a system. An answer to a security question that the system uses to confirm that the person is authorized to the account. This is typically used in resetting the password on a system. A question that the user has selected and paired with a challenge answer so that the system can confirm that the person is authorized to the account.  This is typically used to enable a higher risk transaction on an account that requires a higher level of authentication to perform the transaction, such as sending money externally. An answer to a challenge question that allows the system to confirm that the person is authorized to the account. This is typically used to enable a higher risk transaction on an account that requires a higher level of authentication to perform the transaction, such as sending money externally. A phrase that the user can assign so that when they log into their account, the user can confirm that they have not been sent to a different website. This prevents them from performing transactions or providing confidential information on a fraudulent site. A URL to an image that the user selected and assigned to their account so that when they log into their account, the user can confirm that they have not been sent to a different website. This prevents them from performing transactions or providing confidential information on a fraudulent site. A pointer to an image in the artifact repositor that the user selected and assigned to their account so that when they log into their account, the user can confirm that they have not been sent to a different website. This prevents them from performing transactions or providing confidential information on a fraudulent site. Can be used to authorize transactions such as wire transfers, password reset, ACH transactions, etc. Other credential type, see element credentialSubType for additional detail.
